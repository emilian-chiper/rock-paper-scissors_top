## Documentation

The game logic is implemented in `script.js`. Here are the details of the functions used:

### main

The main function that initializes the game

### getComputerChoice

```javascript
const getComputerChoice = function () {
  const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * choices.length);
  const computerChoice = choices[randomIndex].name;
  return computerChoice;
};
```

Returns a random choice for the computer.

### determineWinner

```javascript
const determineWinner = function (humanChoice, computerChoice) {
  const result =
    humanChoice === computerChoice
      ? "It's a tie!"
      : winningCases[humanChoice] === computerChoice
      ? "You win!"
      : "Computer wins!";
  return result;
};
```

Determines the winner of a round based on the human's and computer's choices.

### updateDisplay

```javascript
const updateDisplay = function (state, humanChoice, computerChoice, prompt) {
  roundsElement.textContent = `Round: ${state.rounds}`;

  humanChoiceElement.src = `./src/img/${humanChoice}.svg`;
  humanScoreElement.textContent = state.humanScore;

  computerChoiceElement.src = `./src/img/${computerChoice}.svg`;
  computerScoreElement.textContent = state.computerScore;

  promptElement.textContent = prompt || "Make your choice ...";
};
```

Updates the game display with the current state, choices, and prompt.

### setInitialDisplay

```javascript
const setInitialDisplay = function (state) {
  updateDisplay(state, "questionmark", "questionmark", "Make your choice...");
};
```

Sets the initial display of the game.

### init

Initializes the game state and attaches event listeners.

### playGame

```javascript
const playGame = function (humanChoice) {
  const computerChoice = getComputerChoice();
  const resultPrompt = determineWinner(humanChoice, computerChoice);

  state.humanScore += resultPrompt === "You win!" ? 1 : 0;
  state.computerScore += resultPrompt === "Computer wins!" ? 1 : 0;
  state.rounds += 1;

  updateDisplay(state, humanChoice, computerChoice, resultPrompt);

  // Best-Of-5
  const isGameOver = state.rounds === 5;
  if (isGameOver)
    promptElement.textContent =
      state.humanScore > state.computerScore
        ? "You win the match!"
        : state.humanScore < state.computerScore
        ? "Computer wins the match!"
        : "The match is undecided";

  choices.forEach((choice) => (choice.element.disabled = isGameOver));
};
```

Plays a round of the game and updates the state and display accordingly.

### resetGame

```javascript
const resetGame = function () {
  state.humanScore = 0;
  state.computerScore = 0;
  state.rounds = 1;
  setInitialDisplay(state);
  choices.forEach((choice) => (choice.element.disabled = false));
};
```

Resets the game to its initial state.

### attachEventListeners

```javascript
const attachEventListeners = function () {
  playButtons.forEach((btn, i) => {
    btn.addEventListener("click", function () {
      const humanChoice = choices[i].name;
      playGame(humanChoice);
    });
  });

  resetButtonElement.addEventListener("click", resetGame);
};
```

Attaches event listeners to the play and reset buttons.
